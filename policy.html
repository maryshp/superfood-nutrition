<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>Effective Date: April 24, 2017.</p>
<h3>General</h3>
<p2>This Privacy Policy applies to information we collect when you use <a href="index.html">www.sfnutrition.com</a> and any other websites, mobile applications (“app(s)”), or services that post a link to this Privacy Policy (collectively, the “Service”). This Privacy Policy describes how Whole Foods Market Services, Inc., 550 Bowie Street Austin, TX 78703-4644, United States and Fresh &amp; Wild Limited, The Barkers Building, 63-97 Kensington High Street, London, W8 5SE, United Kingdom (“Whole Foods,” “Company,” “we,” or “us”) collect, use and share Service-related information about you. This Privacy Policy does not apply to information or data about you collected as received outside of the Service except to the extent it is combined with information or data collected by us via the Service.</p2>
<p>By using our Service, you agree to our <a href="#">Terms of Service</a> and consent to our collection, use and disclosure practices, and other activities as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>We participate in and comply with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of Personal Data from the European Economic Area ("EEA") member countries. You can find out more about our commitment to the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework in our EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Notice available here: <a href="//wholefoodsmarket.com/eu-us-privacy-shield-notice">https://wholefoodsmarket.com/eu-us-privacy-shield-notice</a>. Further information about this framework is set out below. California residents have certain rights set forth in "<a href="#california">Your California Privacy Rights</a>” below. U.K. residents have certain rights set forth in "<a href="#uk">Your U.K. Privacy Rights</a>” below.</p>

<h3><a name="collectinfo" id="collectinfo"></a>Collection of Information</h3>
<p><strong>Information You Provide to Us</strong></p>
<p>We collect information you provide directly to us via the Service, such as when you register, create an account profile, subscribe to our emails, mobile messages, push notifications, or social media notifications, post on our forums or blogs, participate in a sweepstakes, contest, promotion, survey, or poll, communicate with us, shop our online store, order physical or digital gift cards, request customer support, apply for a job or otherwise communicate with us through the Service.</p>
<p>The types of information we may collect includes Personal Information/Personal Data. "Personal Information/Personal Data" is information that can be used to identify you (whether alone or in combination), such as your first and last name, email address, zip code/post code, billing address, shipping address, phone number, payment card information, user name and password, photo, and any other personally identifiable information you choose to provide. It also may include sensitive information, such as health and family information. As permitted by applicable law, unless otherwise provided in this Privacy Policy or in our statements at the point of collection, (i) non-Personal Information/ Personal Data (“non-personal information”) may be used and shared without obligation to you; and (ii) Personal Information/Personal Data may be de-identifiable or otherwise made into non-personal information. We may give you the opportunity to provide us with information about you, your family and your interests in your account profile and otherwise, which if not linked to your Personal Information/Personal Data would be non-personal information. However, to the extent we combine this with your Personal Information/Personal Data collected via the Service, we will treat that combine data as Personal Information/Personal Data under this Privacy Policy. For information on how to change or update your registration information and account profile, see the <a href="#profile-apps">Your Choices: Profile and Apps</a> section below.</p>
<p><a name="infocollectauto" id="infocollectauto"></a><strong>Information We Collect Automatically</strong></p>
<p>We, our service providers and Third Party Services (defined below) may automatically collect certain information about you when you access or use our Service. This information, which may in some cases be considered Personal Information/Personal Data under applicable law, may include demographic information; IP address; browser/device/hardware type; operating system characteristics; information about your use of our Service; and data regarding network connected hardware (e.g., computer or mobile device), such as unique device identifiers, type, model, version, MAC address, device or session ID, error related data status, capability, confirmation, functionality, performance data, and connection type. This information may also include clickstream data, which is information about the page-by-page paths you take as you browse through the Service.</p>
<p>The methods that we, our service providers and Third Party Services may use to automatically collect such information in connection with our Service include:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Log Information</strong>: Information about your use of our Service, such as the type of browser you use, access times, pages viewed, your IP address and the referring link through which you accessed our Service.</li>
    <li><strong>Information Collected by Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies</strong>: We and third parties may use cookies, web beacons (also known as "tracking pixels") and other currently now existing or hereafter developed tracking technologies (“Tracking Technologies”) to collect information about you when you interact with our Service or emails, or third party sites and services, including information about your browsing and purchasing behavior. We and third parties may combine this information with other information about you and use it for various purposes, such as improving our Service and your online experience, providing you with more relevant content, offers and ads, recognizing you across devices, understanding which areas and features of our Service are popular, counting visits, understanding campaign effectiveness, tailoring our communications with you, determining whether an email has been opened and links within the email have been clicked, detecting and preventing fraud and misuse, and for other business purposes. Tracking Technologies you may encounter in connection with the Service include:
        <ul><li><strong>Cookies</strong>: Cookies are data files that are placed on a computer when it is used to visit a website. These cookies may be used for many purposes, including, without limitation, tracking user preferences or web pages visited while using our Service. Most web browsers are set to accept cookies by default. If you prefer, you can usually set your browser to remove or reject cookies, but note that doing so does not necessarily affect third party flash cookies used in connection with our Service. For more information about disabling flash cookies, see <a href="#">http://www.adobe.com/products/flashplayer/security</a>. Please note that if you choose to remove or reject cookies, this could affect the availability and functionality of our Service. For example, cookies allow us to store items in your cart between visits. In addition, please be aware that if you choose to block or delete cookies, some advertising preferences that are dependent on cookies may not be able to be respected. For further information on cookies, please visit our <a href="#">Cookie Policy</a>.</li>
            <li><strong>Web Beacons: </strong>Small graphic images called web beacons, also known as "Internet tags" or "clear gifs," in our web pages and email messages. We may use web beacons or similar technologies for a number of purposes, including, without limitation, to count the number of visitors to our Service, to monitor how users navigate the Service, and to count how many emails that we sent were actually opened or how many particular articles or links were actually viewed.</li>
            <li><strong>Embedded Scripts: </strong>An embedded script is programming code that is designed to collect information about your interactions with the Service. It is temporarily downloaded onto your computer from our web server or a third party with whom we work, is active only while you are connected to the Service, and is deleted or deactivated thereafter.</li>
            <li><strong>Location-identifying Technologies</strong>: GPS (global positioning systems) software, geo-filtering and other location-aware technologies locate (sometimes precisely) you, or make assumptions about your location, for purposes such as verifying your location and delivering or restricting content based on your location. If you have enabled GPS or use other location-based features on the Service, your device location may be tracked. Our store finder feature may access and use information about your device location (such as based on IP address), or your account information, to suggest appropriate store locations.</li>
            <li><strong>Fingerprinting</strong>: Collection and analysis of information from your device, such as, without limitation, your operating system, plug-ins, system fonts, and other data, for purposes of identification and/or tracking.</li>
            <li><strong>Device Recognition Technologies</strong>: Technologies, including application of statistical probability to data sets, as well as linking a common unique identifier to different device use (e.g., Facebook ID), which attempt to recognize or make assumptions about users and devices (e.g., that a user of multiple devices is the same user or household)(“Cross-device Data”).</li>
            <li><strong>In-App Tracking Methods</strong>: There are a variety of Tracking Technologies that may be included in mobile applications, and these are not browser-based like cookies and cannot be controlled by browser settings. Some use device identifier, or other identifiers such as “Ad IDs” to associate app user activity to a particular app and to track user activity across apps and/or devices.</li>
        </ul></li>
</ul><p>Information we automatically collect about you, such as how you interact with our Service, may be combined with your Personal Information/Personal Data. To the extent we associate any such automatically-collected information with Personal Information/Personal Data about you collected via the Service, we will treat the combined information as Personal Information/Personal Data under this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>We, our service providers and other third parties may associate Tracking Technologies with your device when you visit the Service that permits tracking of your online activities across time and different services, and associate different devices you use, for purposes including to send you product promotions that are aligned with your purchase trends and/or interests identified through automatically-collected information. See the <a href="#">Advertising &amp; Analytics Services and Online Tracking</a> and <a href="#analytics">Analytics, Advertising, Online Tracking</a> and Your Choices sections below for more information on use of Tracking Technologies and your choices regarding that. We are giving you notice of the Tracking Technologies and your choices regarding them so that your consent to encountering them is meaningfully informed.</p>
<p><a name="infocollectother" id="infocollectother"></a><strong>Information We Collect From Other Sources</strong></p>
<p>We may also obtain information about you (such as email, address, demographic information and Cross-device Data) from other sources and combine that with information we collect about you. To the extent we receive information about you from a third party source and we combine the information we receive from these third party sources with your Personal Information/Personal Data we collect via the Service, we will treat that combined information as Personal Information/Personal Data under this Privacy Policy. We are not responsible for the accuracy of the information provided by third parties or how such third parties collect, use and share such information.</p>
<p><strong><a name="advertising" id="advertising"></a>Advertising &amp; Analytics Services and Online Tracking</strong></p>
<p>We engage third parties, such as Google’s DoubleClick, and others, to serve advertisements on our behalf across the Internet, to provide us with additional data about you (including Cross-device Data and demographic information) and to provide analytics about the use of our Service. In addition, we may participate in online advertising networks and exchanges that display relevant advertisements to our Service visitors based on their interests as reflected in their browsing of the Service and certain third party sites participating in the same networks and exchanges. These entities may use cookies, web beacons, pixels, embedded scripts, and other Tracking Technologies to automatically collect information about your use of the Service, such as your IP address, web browser, pages viewed, time spent on pages, links clicked and conversion information. This information may be used by us and others to, among other things, analyze and track data, determine the popularity of certain content, deliver advertising and content targeted to your interests on the Service and other websites and better understand your online activity.</p>
<p>This means that some information about your browsing of the Service and certain third party locations and services may be shared with these companies for the purpose of delivering content, offers and ads to you on the Service and certain third party locations and services, and Whole Foods Market may receive from some of these companies information about third party locations and services that you have visited and other information about you, including Cross-device Data. This information may be used for marketing purposes and the practice is sometimes termed “interest-based advertising” or "retargeting" to indicate that information from one retailer is used to suggest to you relevant products offered by another retailer. We may also work with third parties to serve ads to you as part of a customized campaign on other websites or platforms. We may also use this data to provide you with more relevant content and offers on our Service and in our communications to you.</p>
<p>These and other third parties may also collect information about your online activities over time and across different websites when you use our Service.</p>
<p>The descriptions of our data practices in this Privacy Policy does not cover any third party activities of third parties’ use of information that such third parties themselves may have collected from you (e.g., type of browser, operating system, domain name, day and time of visit, page(s) visited, Cross-device Data, etc.) or the methods used by the third-parties to collect that information (e.g., cookies, web beacons and clear gifs). Some third parties, however, may offer you choices regarding their Tracking Technologies. One way to potentially identify cookies on our Service is to add the free Ghostery plug-in to your browser, which according to Ghostery will display for you traditional, browser based cookies associated with the web sites (but not mobile apps) you visited and privacy and opt-out policies and options of the parties operating those cookies. We are not responsible for the completeness or accuracy of this tool or third party choice notices or mechanisms. For specific information on some of the choice options offered by third party analytics, data and advertising providers, see the <a href="#">Analytics, Advertising, Online Tracking and Your Choices</a> section below.</p>
<p>Note that your browser settings may allow you to automatically transmit a “Do Not Track” signal to websites and online services you visit. There is no consensus among industry participants as to what “Do Not Track” means in this context. Like many websites and online services, Whole Foods Market currently does not alter its practices when it receives a “Do Not Track” signal from a visitor’s browser. To find out more about “Do Not Track,” you may wish to visit <a href="#">http://www.allaboutdnt.com</a>.</p>

You may also remove yourself from our promotional email list by clicking on the unsubscribe link presented in all promotional emails, including newsletters, we send to our customers. Please note that even if you opt out of receiving promotional communications, we may continue to send you non-promotional emails, such as those about our on-going business relations. Our mobile applications may send you notifications that may include alerts, sounds, and icon badges. These push notifications or in-app messages may include both operational messages and promotional messages regarding products, services and offers that may be of interest to you. These can be configured in the app’s Settings. As with emails, even if you opt out of receiving promotional communications, we may continue to send you non-promotional push notifications, such as those about your use of the app or our on-going business relations.</p>

<p>You are responsible for maintaining the accuracy of the information you submit to us, such as your contact information provided as part of registration. The Service may allow you to review, correct or update Personal Information/Personal Data, and to change your communications and interest preferences you have provided through the Service’s registration or in your account profile, which changes may be limited to those databases. If you would like to otherwise, review, correct or update Personal Information/Personal Data you have provided us through the Service, contact us by using the <a href="#privacycontactform">contact form</a> below. We will make good faith efforts to make requested changes in our then-active databases as soon as reasonably practicable (but we may retain prior information as business records).</p>
<p>With respect to our apps, you can prospectively stop all collection of data via the app by uninstalling the app. Also, you may be able to exercise specific privacy choices, such as enabling or disabling certain location-based services, by adjusting the permissions in your mobile device or in the app’s settings. However, other means of establishing or estimating location (e.g., connecting to or proximity to wi-fi, Bluetooth, beacons or our networks) may persist. See also the next section regarding the DAA’s mobile interest-based advertising choices.</p>
<p>Please note that it is not always possible to completely remove or delete all of your information from our databases and that residual data may remain on backup media or for other reasons. Also, if you have made any public postings on the Service such as in forums or blogs, these communications cannot generally be removed, except California and U.K. minors should see the <a href="#children">Children section</a> below.</p>

<p>You can learn more about the practices of third parties that associate cookies with our Service, and the choices they offer, by reviewing their privacy policies. See the <a href="#advertising">Advertising &amp; Analytics Services and Online Tracking</a> section above for how to identify cookies and information on their operators and the choices they may offer. For instance, you can learn more about the privacy practices of, and choices offered by, One Spot and AdNexus, which provide us data for, and assist us in, content and ad customization at: <a href="#">https://www.onespot.com/privacy-policy/</a>; and <a href="#">https://www.appnexus.com/en/company/platform-privacy-policy#choices</a>.</p>
<p>In addition, certain advertising networks and exchanges may participate in the Digital Advertising Alliance ("DAA") AdChoices Program and may display an Advertising Option Icon for interest-based ads. You can learn more about the DAA AdChoices Program at <a href="#">http://www.youradchoices.com/</a> and its opt-out program for mobile apps at <a href="#">http://www.aboutads.info/appchoices</a>. In addition, certain advertising networks and exchanges may participate in the Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”). The NAI has developed a tool that allows consumers to opt out of targeted advertising delivered by NAI members' ad networks. To learn more about opting out of targeted advertising or to use the tool, click here: <a href="#">http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/</a>. Please be aware that, even if you are able to opt out of certain kinds of targeted advertising, you will continue to receive other types of ads. Also, if your browsers are configured to reject cookies when you visit these opt-out webpages, or you subsequently erase your cookies, use of a different device or web browsers or use a non-browser-based method of access (e.g., mobile app ), your NAIIDAA browser-based opt-out may not, or may no longer, be effective. Whole Foods Market supports the ad industry’s 2009 Self-regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising (<a href="#">http://www.iab.net/media/file/ven-principles-07-01-09.pdf</a>) and expects that ad networks we directly engage to serve you interest-based advertising will do so as well, though Whole Foods Market cannot guaranty their compliance. We are not responsible for effectiveness of, or compliance with, any third-parties’ opt-out options or programs or the accuracy of their statements regarding their programs.</p>
